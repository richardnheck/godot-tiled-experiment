# godot-tiled-experiment
An experiment importing Tiled maps in Godot

This project shows how a tilemap can be created in Tiled and imported into Godot.

It uses this addon for importing maps from Tiled
https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer

This project demonstrates:
* tiles with collision
* spawning scenes to replace objects specified in Tiled (e.g. key, door, player spawn position etc)
